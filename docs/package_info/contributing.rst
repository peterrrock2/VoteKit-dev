Contributing to VoteKit
==========================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to VoteKit! This document provides
guidelines for contributing to the VoteKit project. All contributions and 
feedback are welcome and appreciated ðŸ˜Š. The closer you can follow these guidelines, the 
faster your contributions can enter the codebase. Before drafting your contribution, we recommend reaching out to 
"code[at]mggg[dot]org" to discuss your feature and how you plan to incorporate it into the codebase.


Contributing Guidelines
=======================

**Coding Standards**: VoteKit follows PEP 8 guidelines for coding style, so we
ask that any contributors do the same to ensure that the codebase is consistent. For
more information, see the `PEP 8 Style Guide <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.

**Writing Tests**: If you write a new feature, you also need to write a set of tests. A test is a short piece of code that checks that the package is working as intended.
While it is not feasible to test every single aspect of a package, adding tests for new features is a crucial part
of open-source software. You can use our `current tests <https://github.com/mggg/VoteKit/blob/main/tests>`_  as a starting place 
to show you how these work, or read this `tutorial <https://realpython.com/python-testing/>`_. Depending on the scale of your feature, you may need multiple tests.
At minimum, your tests should 

- check the basic functionality of your feature, such as a test case of an algorithm or an instantiation of a class, and 
- ensure that any error messages are correctly raised. As a part of the error messages, it is expected that you try to predict, test for, and handle relevant edge cases. It will not be possible to get all of them, but obvious edge cases should be checked (type errors, empty elements, etc.).

**Documentation**: For any new features that you add, please make sure to include
a comprehensive docstring. We have a defined format for docstrings that we use
throughout the `codebase <https://github.com/mggg/VoteKit/blob/main/src/votekit>`_.  This format is a slight riff on the Google Python `style <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings>`_,
where we move the first line of the docstring onto its own line. Please make sure that any additions are consistent
with that format.

Broadly, we write a short description of the function or class.
We then list the arguments, their type, whether they are optional, and what the default behavior is if they are optional.
We then list the return type and a short description of what is being returned.

For example, 

.. code-block:: python

   def remove_cand(
    removed: Union[str, list],
    profile_or_ballots: COB,
    condense: bool = True,
    leave_zero_weight_ballots: bool = False,
    ) -> COB:
    """
    Removes specified candidate(s) from profile, ballot, or list of ballots. When a candidate is
    removed from a ballot, lower ranked candidates are moved up.
    Automatically condenses any ballots that match as result of scrubbing.

    Args:
        removed (Union[str, list]): Candidate or list of candidates to be removed.
        profile_or_ballots (Union[PreferenceProfile, tuple[Ballot,...], Ballot]): Collection
            of ballots to remove candidates from.
        condense (bool, optional): Whether or not to return a condensed profile. Defaults to True.
        leave_zero_weight_ballots (bool, optional): Whether or not to leave ballots with zero
            weight in the PreferenceProfile. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        Union[PreferenceProfile, tuple[Ballot,...],Ballot]:
            Updated collection of ballots with candidate(s) removed.
    """



Poetry
=============

VoteKit uses Poetry to manage the package and all of its dependencies; Poetry is not needed for standard users, but developers will find it useful.
To install Poetry, within your :doc:`virtual environment <../user/install>`, run ``pip install poetry``.
Then, run ``poetry install`` from within the root of your VoteKit project directory to install all dependencies. 
This will add the necessary dependencies to a ``.venv`` directory.
Once you've run ``poetry install``,  run ``poetry run pre-commit install``, which will install code linting hooks that will run on every commit. 
This helps ensure code quality, like automatically checking formatting.



Using GitHub
============
This tutorial assumes some understanding of GitHub, either of the command line interface or of the desktop GUI.
If you are new to GitHub, please feel free to reach out to us at our email, "code[at]mggg[dot]org", and we will schedule some
time to get you started.

Quick Start via Command Line
============================

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork locally**.
3. **Configure the upstream repo** ``git remote add upstream https://github.com/mggg/VoteKit.git``
4. **Create a new branch** for your contribution ``git checkout -b my-new-feature``.
5. **Make your changes** and commit them ``git commit -am 'Add some feature'``.
6. **Run tests and linters** with ``poetry run pytest --runslow tests``, ``poetry run ruff check src tests``, 
    ``poetry run mypy src tests``, and ``black src tests``.
7. **Pull the latest changes from upstream** and rebase your branch if necessary.
8. **Push your branch** to GitHub ``git push origin my-new-feature``.
9. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub.

Quick Start via Desktop GUI
============================

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub. 

    .. image:: ../_static/assets/github_desktop/fork_repo.png
        :align: center

2. **Clone the repository locally**. Copy the url to the repository from GitHub.

    .. image:: ../_static/assets/github_desktop/clone_repo_1.png
        :align: center

    Then from the "File" menu on the GitHub desktop GUI, select "Clone Repository" and provide the url.

3. **Create a new branch** for your feature by selecting "New Branch" from the "Branch" menu.

    .. image:: ../_static/assets/github_desktop/new_branch_1.png
        :align: center

Publish the branch.

    .. image:: ../_static/assets/github_desktop/publish_branch.png
        :align: center

4. **Make your changes** to the VoteKit code base and commit them to your branch.

    .. image:: ../_static/assets/github_desktop/commit.png
        :align: center

5. **Run tests and linters** in the command line at the root of your VoteKit directory
with ``poetry run pytest --runslow tests``, ``poetry run black src tests``, ``poetry run ruff check src tests``, and ``poetry run mypy src tests``.
Make sure your virtual environment is activated.

    .. image:: ../_static/assets/github_desktop/run_tests.png
        :align: center

6. **Pull and push** to your branch.

    .. image:: ../_static/assets/github_desktop/push.png
        :align: center

7. **Open a Pull Request** via the desktop app. 

    .. image:: ../_static/assets/github_desktop/create_PR.png
        :align: center

    Then, on GitHub, make sure you are trying to merge your branch with the main branch of VoteKit and that the branch is able to be merged.
    Write a detailed comment explaining the changes you made and the reasoning behind them.

    .. image:: ../_static/assets/github_desktop/edit_PR_details.png
        :align: center

    After submitting, check that all of the tests have passed. If any have failed, they will appear with a red X.
    The tests must pass before we can merge your code. An MGGG member will review your code and provide you with any 
    changes that need to be made before merging.
